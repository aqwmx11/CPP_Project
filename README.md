# CPP_Project
Hi, this is the repository which contains many of my C++ Projects. Many of them came from the "Programming Design and Algorithm" by Peking University on Coursera. Some came from the book written by Porf. Guo Wei about OOP in C++. Some Came from another sources like a test for a certain function in C++, a question in an interview book, etc. I will continuously add more projects and gradually change the Chinese names into English to make sure everyone understands. I would really appreciate if you want to communicate with me or give any suggetions. Arcues Bless You:)
